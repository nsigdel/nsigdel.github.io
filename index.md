## Background On AI

AI's journey since the 1950s has been a thrilling tale of ups and down. It all began with the fundamental question, "Can machines think like us?" leading to groundbreaking developments like computers learning checkers and mastering tic-tac-toe. The 1956 Dartmouth conference was a milestone, giving AI its name and direction. The field surged with excitement as AI began tackling problems with an almost human touch. Moving through the decades, AI evolved significantly, from symbolic algorithms in the 1970s to machine learning in the 1990s, and then to deep learning in the 2010s. It's experienced seasons of growth and decline, akin to springs and winters. Today, AI is an integral part of our lives, influencing everything from entertainment to healthcare. Despite its profound impact, AI's future remains an exciting enigma, teetering between the potential for another winter or an even more flourishing spring, underscoring its deep entwinement in the fabric of modern existence.
